A pretty darn quick CSV exporter

== Description ==

This is a pretty darn quick CSV exporter. Export posts, pages, users, taxonomies, or any custom post type faster
than you thought was possible, with a user interface that's easy to navigate.

Other exporting plugins may take _hours_ or _days_ to export some data from sites with large databases.
This one takes _seconds_ or _minutes_ to export the same data.

Define filters to only export records that meet certain criteria, and choose exactly what fields you want to export.

Save your settings to run the same or similar exports later.

Other exporting plugins may offer filtering, but they break when filtering on numeric values. This one succeeds where
they fail.

This plugin was developed with speed in mind. Other plugins load files and assets even when they're not needed, slowing
down every page load in your WordPress site. This plugin only loads files and assets when absolutely necessary, keeping
your site running smoothly.

Only users with the 'export' capability (such as admins) can use this plugin's features.
